# Telemetry Viewer

This is a fork of a java project from [farrellf/TelemetryViewer](https://github.com/farrellf/TelemetryViewer) that was an idea to stream realtime telemetry data and display it in a dashboard. 

Its archived as this approach is less useable than a simple wepapp in React or Vue (but might come back to this one day... who knows...)
